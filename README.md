### Hi there! I'm Jesus Rodriguez Luna 👋

🔭 I'm currently collaborating on a compelling project with a friend, exploring the realms of MongoDB for our backend, Java for the server-side logic, and diving into JSX for our front end with a focus on React Native.

🌱 I'm in the midst of mastering MongoDB, delving into Javascript's object-oriented programming, and various aspects of JSX. I aim to diversify my skill set and expand my programming language expertise.

💬 I thrive in discussions around programming languages, code optimization, and back-end development. Also, I'm excited to explore new technologies and tools!

🚀 Primarily working with C++ and Java, I pride myself on adaptability and my eagerness to learn new languages and frameworks when the need arises.

💻 My arsenal involves working with MongoDB for backend systems, Java for robust server-side development, and possibly JSX for creating an engaging user interface through React Native.

🏆 Certified in C++ and Java OOP, I'm currently mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. I possess hands-on experience in DSA through LeetCode challenges.

🎉 Fun Fact: I enjoy trading stocks, collaborating on coding projects with friends, listening to music (especially on long drives), and maintaining a fitness regimen involving running and gym sessions. I believe in the power of exercise to manage stress and anxiety.

Looking forward to engaging in coding discussions and learning new things!
